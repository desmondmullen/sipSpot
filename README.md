# sipSpot

**sipSpot is a full-stack mobile app that helps you keep track of your things and keep an eye on your drinks intake when you're out for a night on the town** sipSpot was created as the final group project for the Coding Boot Camp at UNC-Chapel Hill in May 2019.


# Features

sipSpot uses geolocation and a simple click of a button to keep track of both where your things are, and your alcohol intake, when you're out on the town. When you click *+Drink*, sipSpot keeps track of the number of drinks you've had **and the timeframe in which you've had them** to constantly update an estimate of your Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC). Having two or three drinks over a number of hours is something many people can handle without a problem, but having two or three drinks in a short time can be very unsafe if you decide to drive home. sipSpot keeps track for you so you can make smart decisions and get home safe.

With *CheckIn*, sipSpot will alert you as you start to leave the area, reminding you to make sure you've collected a credit card you may have left for a tab, or remembered your jacket, your friends, etc.

If your BAC goes over thresholds you choose, sipSpot can give you a gentle reminder (with a link to Uber!) or even automatically send a friend a notification with a link to your location on Google Maps.

One click of the *Uber* button opens your phone's Uber app with your location auto-filled.

Ask your friends to join you! Simply click *Friends* to auto-fill a text message with a Google Maps link with your location.

Click *Menu* at the top left to change thresholds for Alerts, view History, or change your Settings (including weight and gender for more-accurate BAC calculations).


# Future Revisions

The next step for sipSpot is to make it a truly Native application. Currently it has full function on iOS and Android *except* updating in the background. Making it a Native app will resolve the update-in-background issue.
